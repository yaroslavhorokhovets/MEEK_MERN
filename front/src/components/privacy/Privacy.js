                        privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Meek

                        Personal Information include:</p>

                    <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        sweepstakes, and requesting Services or information.</p>

                    <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        As you navigate the Services, certain passive information may
                        also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar
                        technologies as described below.</p>

                    <p>We endeavor to collect
                        only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing. Below

                        with Meek, responding to surveys, requesting Services or information, or
                        contacting us directly, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following
                        types of information:</p>

                    <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communications with Us.&nbsp;We may collect
                        Personal Information from you such as email address, when you choose to request
                        information about our Services, register for Meek’s newsletter or a loyalty
                        program that we may offer from time to time, request to receive customer or
                        technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>

                    <p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveys.&nbsp;From time to time,
                        we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to
                        participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include

                        may be used to reach you about the sweepstakes or contest, and for other

                        containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that
                        they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the

                    <p>You may
                        inquire as to whether Meek is Processing Personal Information about you,
                        request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or
                        delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise
                        permitted by applicable law, you may send an e-mail to&nbsp;<a target="_blank">info@Meek.io</a>&nbsp;or use any of the

                    <p>Although Meek makes good
                        faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information,

                        but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would
                        compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or
                        expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the
                        Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially
                        proprietary. If Meek determines that access should be restricted in any
