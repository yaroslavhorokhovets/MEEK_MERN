                    <p><b>Account
                        Registration</b></p>

                    <p>While you are not required to create an account to access the
                        Service, in order to access certain features of the Service you may be required

                        will receive an account designation. You agree to provide true, accurate,
                        current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Site's
                        registration form (such information being the "Membership Data") and
                        maintain and promptly update the Membership Data to keep it true, accurate,
                        current and complete. If you do not, or Click has reasonable grounds to suspect
                        that you have not, Click may suspend or terminate your account.</p>

                    <p>You may not provide a false email
                        address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to any Membership
                        Data or User Content. You will not post any information about yourself or your
                        identity that you do not want to be displayed on the Site and made available to
                        the public (such as telephone numbers or street addresses). We may use the
                        Membership Data and certain other information you provide in accordance with
                        our Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
                        password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur
                        under your account. You agree to immediately notify Click of any unauthorized
                        use of your account or any other breach of security. Click cannot and will not
                        be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your
                        account.</p>

                    <p>We may offer a number of subscription plans, including special
                        promotions or subscriptions with differing conditions and limitations. Any
                        materially different terms from those described in these Terms will be
                        disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.
                        Generally, your promotional rate (or free trial) will last for the time specified
                        on the promotion or during sign-up, and at the expiration of such promotional
                        period or free trial, your subscription will automatically renew (per prior
                        disclosure to you) at the standard pricing Meek has established at that time.
                        Promotional rates and free trials are only available for new customers unless Meek
                        explicitly states otherwise, and Meek reserves the right to determine your
                        promotional rate or free trial eligibility.</p>

                        Streaming only. For purposes of this Agreement, Streaming means the digital
                        transmission of an audiovisual work via the Internet from the Service to a
                        User's device in such a manner that the data is intended for real-time
                        listening and not intended to be copied, stored or permanently downloaded by

                        Streaming and/or broadcasting is expressly prohibited. This license does not
                        include any resale or commercial use of the Site, the Service, or its contents,
                        or any downloading or copying of account information for the benefit of
                        yourself or any third-party. The Service is for personal use only and may not
                        be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise
                        exploited for any commercial purpose except those that may be specifically
                        endorsed or approved in advance by Click in writing. You may not authorize any
                        third party to use your account. Use of any automated script, program, and or
                        mechanism to collect, scrape, retrieve, and or gather any information and or
                        User Content from the Service is strictly prohibited without prior written
                        consent from Click.</p>

                    <p>If we find you are making illegal and/or unauthorized use of the
                        Service, including without limitation, collecting usernames, email addresses or
                        User Content for any wrongful purpose, or are otherwise violating this
                        Agreement, we may investigate you and/or take any other appropriate action
                        against you. Click reserves the right to remove without notice any commercial
                        advertisements, affiliate links, and other forms of solicitation or spam, which
                        may result in termination of your account and/or Site use privileges.</p>

                    <p>You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any
                        trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, content,

                        You may not use any meta-tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing Click's
                        name or trademarks without the express written consent of Click. Any
                        unauthorized use terminates the permission or license granted by Click. You are
                        granted a limited, revocable, and nonexclusive right to create a hyperlink to
                        the Service so long as the link does not portray Click, its affiliates, or
                        their products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise
                        offensive manner. You may not use any Click logo or other proprietary graphic
                        or trademark as part of the link without Click's advanced express written
                        permission.</p>

                    <p>You will NOT misuse the Service by, including without

                    <p>Without limiting other remedies, if Click finds, in Click's sole
                        discretion, that you have violated this Agreement or misused the Service in any
                        way, Click may warn Users of your actions, issue a warning, and/or temporarily
